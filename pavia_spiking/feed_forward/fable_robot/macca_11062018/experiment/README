the experiment load one module (2 DoF) of the Fable Robot on a table

Transfer Functions
- Planner:
	plan the desired joints trajectory ( infinity loop, circle, fixed reference) and publish it on the "/robot/desired_trajectory/joints" topic
- Controller:
	create an approximate robot model for the inverse dynamics
	connect to the apply_joint_effort service
	compute the joint error and publish it on the topic "/robot/joint_error/position", /robot/joint_error/velocity
	calculate the torque given the desired joints trajectory
	* missing cerebellum output *
	send the final control input to the robot ( joint_1 is the bottom joint)
